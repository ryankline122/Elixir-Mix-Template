# Elixir Mix Project Template 

This template builds off of the code generated with `mix new` to include an entry point, importing modules,
and writing unit tests.

## Useful commands
* `mix escript.build` - creates the executable and sends it to `dist/app`
* `mix test` - runs all unit tests. Add `--cover` to generate coverage report
